# Student-IQ-classification-and-EDA-insights

# Problem statements:
1. Statistical/ML analysis - You are expected to maximize accuracy for prediction of 
students’ extraordinary IQ and make sure that it is justifiable. Please submit the 
model and predicted class without shuffling the sequence of test dataset. Also, you 
are supposed to figure out if there are any associations or correlations of students’ 
academic performance with their background factors. Please support your insights
or claims through proper statistical/ML tests and models.
(Expectations: Document the statistical procedures as well as code (in presentable format) 
that you would adopt for bringing your results, state the motivation behind applying a 
particular model with proper reasoning.)
2. EDA - You are expected to present a compelling story through an informative and 
creative visualization dashboard with key insights for the education department
officials, which would help them in gathering the most valuable actionable insights 
to improve the quality of education.
